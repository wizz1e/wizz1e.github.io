							<p>"Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened. Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household world that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident? Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner. All is well."</p>

							<p>I learned that Bob Pragoff passed away this morning. I'm not sure exactly what happened. I know that he was ill and I thought he was on the mend.<br>Here's what I do know though. Bob Pragoff was a gentleman and teacher and a mentor and a friend. We met when he was the training officer in NH and I was the same in MA. He's from NY originally and he has this great belly laugh that sometimes will also bring tears which is always a good time. I pestered him with questions about everything because I had no idea what I was doing. I slow danced with him at EMI when some drunk firefighter decided a ballad was a good idea.<br>I remember him telling me that he wore a uniform at work which I didn't believe because he would have been such a cute little firefighter. When I left MEMA, he framed and autographed his uniform photo for me as a present. And I've taken it with me to every office for the last 6.5 years.<br>I missed you Bob when you were alive and I miss you even more now that you're gone. I am so lucky to have known you and learned from you, and felt your soft touch on the small of my back while someone butchered "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".<br>Fare well, you Prince of New England.</p>

I will always remember you telling me how you "love to photograph things that are moving and if they aren't moving, they photograph well too".

							<p>Bob Pragoff, It is sad for me to acknowledge that you are no longer physically on this planet. It is tough for me to comprehend that our last conversations shared were over Pro-Board Skill Sheets. You have been not only a blessing to work with, but were always there with an ear to listen, a thought to keep the calmness, and an idea to promote forward progress. It is incomprehensible to think you will no longer make your stroll down to my office to see how I am doing and if I need anything, or if there is anything you could do to help. Your absence, the void left not only in the office but also in my heart is one that will go unfilled for a very long time. I offer a prayer for your family to have the strength to endure the strife and to remember all the good times shared. I pray that all that have been touched by your kindness, embrace who you were, remember all the good you have accomplished, and share stories to remember you as the kind hearted, soft spoken friend to all that you were.

							<p>I got the news early this morning that Bob had passed away. I've spent the day sorting through so many good memories I had with him. There is one that made a real difference and I never told him how much.<br>I got to meet Bob in 2003 when I decided to join Deering Fire & Rescue. He was on my standing committee. He asked me what my strengths and weaknesses were. At the time, I was worried about becoming an interior firefighter. I wasn't so confident that I would be able to stay calm enough to do the job. I will always remember what he told me. "On this department we expect people to try things once. If you decide it isn't for you after that then we will support you in that decision." Since then, whenever I am in a class or training that requires me to do something physically or emotionally taxing, I just whisper to myself "you only have to do this once." Of course I know that we in the fire service have to do whatever is required to get the job done and I will more than likely have to do the task again. However, this mantra is a huge reason I have gained skills and confidence in this field. It has given me moments where I surprised myself in what I can do (and that includes interior firefighting) because it does not allow room for self doubt. I owe that to Bob and I am sorry I never told him.<br>Rest in peace Bob. You will be truly missed for so many reasons. But I also know when I get up there I will hear "Hey Kiddo. How are ya?" and that helps me smile through the tears.</p>

							<p>I'm still shocked and saddened that Bob has passed on. He was taken from us way too soon. Bobby and I met and became friends back in 1965 in Junior High School. He was delightfully different. Different from our classmates, and different from those I knew in elementary school. At the same time, from my 12 y/o eyes, Bobby was also the other "normal" guy (besides me) in our class. Our different personalities meshed perfectly. His engaging and mischievous nature brought me out of my shell and fueled my hidden creative side. We were best of friends. OMG we were going to be rock stars.... until reality set in.. LOL!<br>I have sensed all along that Bob lived the life he wanted to live, doing what he loved where he loved doing it. That he was a civil servant was never a surprise. The accolades and amount of love and respect that he's receiving now is also no surprise. Bobby & I embodied the notion that very good friends dont have to see each other all the time, or even talk that often in order to maintain a friendship. To Marge, and all of Bob's immediate and extended families, you have my sincerest condolances and sympathies. My thoughts are with you. Bobby.... farewell my friend and rest in peace, my brother.</p>

							<p>Remembering Bob Pragoff.<br>I has taken me a while Bob Pragoff to absorb your loss and come to grips with it. You were a lot of thing to me in my life, first you were my friend, and then later you became my brother-in-law. And when I asked you to be my best man on the day I married your sister Barbara when my best friend was not able to be there. Your reply was you would be honored to stand up with me.<br>In the last 24 hours millions on memories are flashing through my head of things we did together and family gatherings. I remember when I was still dating Barbara, you and Margie and also Hal and Jeannie Cole we all went out for a picnic up by a lake for the day. And while we were getting the food together, and I am not sure why you said this you just turned to Jeannie and said ‚ÄúHow are your Tits‚Äù. All of us stopped and turned and Margie yelled out ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù. Meanwhile Hal and I are laughing and then I looked and Jeannie and said everything looks ok to me. After that we sat down and had lunch. For some reason I still remember that day.<br>I also remember the time the two of us took a bus trip across the country from New York to Salt Lake City, Utah. Your sister, Cathy asked you and me to go Utah to get her car and drive to Maryland where she was living. The characters that we met on the bus ride were unreal people. They never met anyone from New York before and wanted to know everything about New York. I recall it got to the point that we had to make up stories to keep them entertained. And the bus drivers got pissed off as us because at one of the stops we pick up a case of beer. What else is there to do on a day 3 day bus ride, so we drank beer and played cards and told crazy stories about our life living in New York? Then after we got to Utah and stayed overnight, we left early next morning and drive south to Arizona where we hooked up to Old Route 66 (now Highway 40) and started driving east to Maryland. We both got to see a lot of America in a few days, but it was worth it.<br>Another time you helped me bring some things down to my sister‚Äôs home in Virginia. So we drove down in your new Jeep, and I recall as soon as we were crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel a blizzard started. But we made it over without and trouble. It gave you a chance to meet my side of the family and I remember you enjoyed hearing my sister‚Äôs kid‚Äôs talk with their southern accents. Like during breakfast my niece asked you ‚ÄúY‚Äôall want some more eggs‚Äù and you cracked up.<br>But the most recent memory is when you and Margie came down to Boston to meet with Barbara and myself for lunch last year, it was the last time we saw you. But the memory of that day will be with us forever.<br>Bob, you are no longer physically here with us and your family. And Margie will see you inside of Cindy, Bobby and Chris whenever she looks at them. And all the people you met and touched in your life time.<br>So you see Bob Pragoff you are still with here us, it‚Äôs just a part of you is with hundreds of other people now. So you are not really gone as long as someone keeps you in their mind and in their heart.<br>So Rest in Peace my brother, and say hello to Mom & Dad‚Ä¶</p>

							<p>I am deeply saddened and in shock of learning of the passing of my good friend Bob Pragoff this morning.<br>Bob was one of the kindest, friendliest and craziest people I've ever had the good fortune to know. Unfortunately life and geography gets in the way and we were out of touch for many years, until we linked up on FB a short time ago. He had worked for Con Ed on their emergency gas system '2 Hour Board', until he moved to NH with his family years ago.<br>Bob and his lovely wife Marge were both in Jeanne and my wedding party. (The 'bookends' in the attached photo).<br>We all spent countless hours together, nights at home with his children Cindy Pragoff, Christopher Pragoff, and Bobby, with their dog Montana, at parties and picnics with Bob's sister Barbara Pragoff Wilson and her husband and friend John Wilson, setting up 'CB' antennas on various Bronx roof tops, installing whip antennas on our cars, and riding around on neighborhood watch security patrols at night.<br>I remember walking the streets with him with flashlights in hand during one of the great blackouts.<br>Bob and I both shared a love of photography and he was great at it. Jeanne and my deepest, heartfelt condolences and prayers go out to Margie, Cindy, Chris, Bobby, Barbara and John. Rest in peace my friend, rest in peace <a href="https://images.typed.com/e842cdf2-64d9-4dc3-87fc-9f4dd473e25d/HaroldACole.jpg">'Gasman'</a>.<br>Many a night we cruised the streets of the Bronx in <a href="https://images.typed.com/fa3bc2a9-6b73-4837-82c5-df14a338a787/HaroldACole2.jpg">Bob's Golden Eagle</a>, keeping the neighborhood safe... somewhat.</p>

							<p>I've put together a short <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harold.cole.75/videos/873356749444790/">vignette</a> in memory of my friend Bob who has left us too soon. I admit to stealing one photo from another Facebook page as I haven't seen Bob in years, but it was such a great photo I had to end with it. I hope it brings happy memories to those who knew him then, and joy and laughter to his friends and colleagues of more recent times. Bob was a treasure to always be remembered. Don't forget to enable sound.</p>

							<p>Bobby, Joe and I heard about your passing yesterday and are still in shock! Joe said it feels like only yesterday that the two of you used to race around the streets of the Bronx in his Chevelle and cruise around in your black Chevy van. The two of you have known each other for 55 years. From your days in P.S. 46 through adulthood. I remember your apartment on 201st Street and Briggs and hanging out there with you, Margie and the kids! I'm so glad we connected on Facebook and were able to catch up. Rest easy our dear friend. The Heavens have just gained another angel. Our love and heartfelt prayers are with Margie, Cindy, Bobby, and Chris. xoxo</p>

							<p>I have been thinking for days on what to write about you Bob. And my head spins with all the amazing story's. I never had the opportunity to go into a burning building with Bob I never got to take a firefighting class Bob taught. But what I did learn from Bob at a young age of 21 is to smile laugh have fun and enjoy life. I met Bob in 2004 he was a bagpiper I was a brand new firefighter for the city of Manchester they use to hold band practice at the station I worked at one practice while sitting in the bay's Bob approached me and asked if I could keep a beat ( me having no musical talents at all said I can try) while failing to keep the beat on a trash can cover (knowing I was awful) Bob looked over at me with his grin and said you keep coming around I'll help make a drummer out of you. I lasted 12 years with the band and every event while Bob was involved in the band Bob was there some fun events some lodd every event he had a smile that lite up the room. Bob keep playing those bagpipes and keep smiling down on us from above. Thank you for touching all our lives and we will see you when we meet again brother. RIP</p>
