jQuery WebTicker is available under a dual licence.

1. (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License)[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/]

Thus it is free to use & modify for private non-commercial use, as long as the licence is included. However all donations are of course appreciated.

2. Commercial Donationware licence stipulated below.

If you use jQuery WebTicker in a commercial setting, the author of this package humbly asks that you make a donation. 
This donation is not compulsory, but it would sure help defray my costs of developing & mantaining the webTicker which you are using right now. 
Especially in the case of agencies where the small-cost can be passed to the client.
The full license details are given below.

jQuery WebTicker has taken some considerable time to develop, please allow me to continue its development and support the author by donating. 
All monies will go towards new features, enhancements, hosting costs, and bug fixes.

With the work load I had I have not been able to update and patch as regularly hence I opted to change the licence to provide a better product more suited towards commercial use.
